# NOTE: We didn't make it to implementing this in time for iter 4-2. We put it last due to its low priority for Darren
# We may still be able to fill it in before the final handoff. 
# Feature: High priority projects should be marked in the model
#   As a TA
#   In order to assure that loyal customers get their projects matched
#   I want to be able to flag certain projects are requiring a match

#   Scenario: high priority tag is assigned to high priority projects
#     Given I am on the home page
#     And I am logged in as a TA
#     And I fill in the google settings
#     And All data is put into the database
#     Then high priority projects are marked so in the database

#   Scenario: high priority tag is not assigned to non high priority projects
#     Given I am on the home page
#     And I am logged in as a TA
#     And I fill in the google settings
#     And All data is put into the database
#     Then non high priority projects are not marked as high priority in the database
